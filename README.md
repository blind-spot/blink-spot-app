# Hack The Commute: Blind Spot

The purpose of this app is to provide an easy, quick, modern, open source, and multi-modal utility for crowd-sourcing input from citizens about everything from problem spots in their neighborhoods to possible improvements to incidents (minor crashes, near misses, etc).

This application was developed on March 20-22, 2015 for [Hack The Commute](https://codeforseattle.hackpad.com/Hack-the-Commute-2h8AsgMYcB8).

## Challenge and Approach

Our submission is for [Challenge #3: Build an app that provides an example of an Awesome Hackathon submission](http://example.com/this-also-goes-nowhere)i

Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

- Develop an example Git repository
- Share it on Github
- Collect feedback from the community

Once we did that, we knew we were guaranteed to win!

## Team Members

Our team is comprised of:

## Technologies, APIs, and Datasets Utilized

We made use of:

- Hand harvested unicorn tears. Unicorns are very happy creatures, its hard to make them cry.
- [mod_bf](http://modbf.sourceforge.net/)
- The [Top 1,000 Songs To Hear Before You Die](https://opendata.socrata.com/Fun/Top-1-000-Songs-To-Hear-Before-You-Die/ed74-c6ni) dataset and [API](http://dev.socrata.com/foundry/#/opendata.socrata.com/ed74-c6ni)

## Contributing

In order to build and run our app:

1. Harvest yourself some unicorn tears. They're expensive to purchase on your own.
2. [Deploy your the code](https://github.com/masylum/Brainfuck-on-Rails) to [Heroku](http://heroku.com)
3. Profit
